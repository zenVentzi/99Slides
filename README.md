Copy-pasted (and stupid)description from [GooglePlay store](https://web.archive.org/web/20151117174049/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Toughwin.ninetyNineSlides) below.
Contrary to what the web-archive says, the installs got around 40k at some point before it was taken down for absolutely no reasonable-reason, along with 4 the other games. So, it sucked but it was playable. The In-App-Purchases were a naive move, and I think we got just a few from friends.
